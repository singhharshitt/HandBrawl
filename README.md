# HandBrawl
HandBrawl is a basic yet interactive Stone-Paper-Scissors game built to strengthen my frontend development skills. Designed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JS, this project focuses on responsive layout, clean UI, and simple game logic. It's a fun and lightweight project aimed at practicing DOM manipulation, grid layout, and event-driven programming.
